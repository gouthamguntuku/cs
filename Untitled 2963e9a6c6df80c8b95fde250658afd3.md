# 🚀 Complete DevOps Roadmap 2025: Zero to Hero

This comprehensive, up-to-date DevOps roadmap is designed to take you from absolute beginner to expert DevOps engineer by 2025. It’s structured in progressive phases, with hands-on projects, tools, and learning resources.

---

## 🔰 Phase 0: Foundations (1–2 Months)

### ✅ Prerequisites

- **Basic Computer Literacy**: OS concepts, file systems, CLI
- **Networking Fundamentals**: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, firewalls
- **Linux/Unix Basics**:
    - File system navigation (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`)
    - File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
    - Text processing (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`)
    - Package management (`apt`, `yum`, `dnf`)
- **Scripting**:
    - **Bash/Shell scripting** (essential)
    - **Python** (highly recommended for automation)

> 💡 Project: Write a Bash script that automates system health checks (CPU, memory, disk usage) and sends alerts via email or Slack.
> 

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Core DevOps Concepts & Tools (2–3 Months)

### 🔧 Version Control

- **Git & GitHub/GitLab**:
    - Branching strategies (GitFlow, trunk-based)
    - Pull/Merge requests, rebasing
    - `.gitignore`, hooks, submodules

### 📦 CI/CD Fundamentals

- Understand **CI/CD pipeline stages**: build → test → deploy
- Learn **pipeline as code**
- Tools:
    - **GitHub Actions** (great for beginners)
    - **GitLab CI/CD**
    - **Jenkins** (legacy but still widely used)

> 💡 Project: Build a CI pipeline for a Python/Node.js app that runs unit tests on every push and deploys to a staging environment.
> 

---

## ☁️ Phase 2: Cloud & Infrastructure (2–4 Months)

### ☁️ Cloud Platforms (Pick **one** to start—AWS recommended)

- **AWS** (most market share):
    - EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, RDS, Lambda, ECR, ECS/EKS
- **Azure** or **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** (optional but valuable)

### 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Terraform** (multi-cloud, declarative, industry standard)
- **AWS CloudFormation** (if using AWS)
- **Pulumi** (emerging, uses real programming languages)

### 🐳 Containerization

- **Docker**:
    - Images, containers, volumes, networks
    - Dockerfile best practices
    - Multi-stage builds
- **Container Registries**: Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCR, ACR

> 💡 Project: Deploy a 3-tier app (frontend, backend, DB) using Docker Compose, then deploy it to AWS using Terraform + EC2 or ECS.
> 

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Advanced CI/CD & Orchestration (2–3 Months)

### 🚢 Container Orchestration

- **Kubernetes (K8s)**:
    - Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets
    - Helm charts
    - Kustomize
- Managed K8s: **EKS (AWS)**, **AKS (Azure)**, **GKE (GCP)**

### 🛠️ Advanced CI/CD

- **Argo CD** (GitOps)
- **Tekton** (Kubernetes-native CI/CD)
- **Spinnaker** (for advanced deployment strategies)

### 🔄 Deployment Strategies

- Blue/Green
- Canary
- Rolling updates
- Feature flags

> 💡 Project: Migrate your Docker app to Kubernetes on EKS using Terraform. Set up Argo CD for GitOps-based deployments with canary releases.
> 

---

## 🔒 Phase 4: Observability, Security & Reliability (2–3 Months)

### 👀 Observability

- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki + Grafana
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, New Relic
- **Tracing**: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry

### 🔐 DevSecOps

- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager
- **Static/Dynamic Analysis**: SonarQube, Snyk, Trivy, OWASP ZAP
- **Policy as Code**: Open Policy Agent (OPA), HashiCorp Sentinel

### 🛡️ Infrastructure Security

- Least privilege IAM roles
- Network security (security groups, NACLs)
- Container scanning
- CIS benchmarks

> 💡 Project: Add monitoring to your K8s cluster using Prometheus + Grafana. Implement Trivy for image scanning in your CI pipeline and Vault for secret injection.
> 

---

## 🧠 Phase 5: Advanced Topics & Specialization (Ongoing)

### 📈 Scalability & Performance

- Auto-scaling (K8s HPA, cloud-native)
- Load testing (k6, Locust)
- Caching (Redis, CDN)

### 🧩 Service Mesh (Optional but valuable)

- **Istio** or **Linkerd**

### 🤖 Infrastructure Automation & GitOps

- **FluxCD** (alternative to Argo CD)
- **Crossplane** (infrastructure composition)

### ☁️ Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Strategies

- Design for portability
- Cost optimization tools (AWS Cost Explorer, Kubecost)

### 🧪 Chaos Engineering

- **Chaos Monkey**, **LitmusChaos**

> 💡 Project: Simulate a failure in your K8s cluster using LitmusChaos and observe how your system recovers. Implement cost alerts using Kubecost.
> 

---

## 🎯 Phase 6: Real-World Mastery (Ongoing)

### 📚 Soft Skills & Best Practices

- **SRE Principles** (Google SRE Book)
- **Incident Response & Postmortems**
- **Documentation** (Markdown, Confluence)
- **Collaboration with Dev & QA teams**

### 🏆 Certifications (Optional but helpful)

- **AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional**
- **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**
- **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate**
- **Google Professional DevOps Engineer**

### 🌐 Community & Continuous Learning

- Contribute to open-source DevOps tools
- Attend meetups (DevOpsDays, KubeCon)
- Follow blogs: [DevOps.com](http://devops.com/), CNCF, AWS Blog, etc.

## 💡 Final Tips

1. **Build, don’t just watch**: Every concept should be tested in a sandbox (use free tiers!).
2. **Automate everything**: If you do it twice, script it.
3. **Think in pipelines**: From code commit to production monitoring.
4. **Embrace failure**: DevOps is about resilience and learning from outages.
5. **Stay updated**: DevOps evolves fast—follow CNCF, AWS, and HashiCorp blogs.
